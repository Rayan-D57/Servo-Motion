# Servo-Motion

Project Description

Objective
This project aims to program 6 servo motors to control the movement of a humanoid robot in a structured manner. Each servo motor will first be tested individually to ensure proper functionality. After verification, the servos will be programmed together to execute a walking motion for the robot.

Work Process

Testing Each Servo Motor Individually
 • Each servo will be tested separately using the Sweep example for two seconds.
 • The movement will be checked to ensure smooth operation from 0° to 180° and back.
 • After testing, the servo will be set to 90 degrees to hold its position.

Integrating the Servos for Walking Motion
 • Once all servos are confirmed to be working correctly, a walking algorithm will be implemented.
 • The servos will be controlled to simulate human-like walking steps, including lifting a leg, moving it forward, and balancing the body.
 • All 6 servos will work together to synchronize the leg and torso movements, ensuring stability during walking.
